# BasicJavaConcurrencyProject

This project is more of a practical example of Java concurrency techniques than an actual portfolio project. Due to a tight time schedule, we didn't spend too much time on concurrency in the university class which usually teaches it. I figured concurrency was an important concept to understand if I wanted to enter the tech industry one day, so I've been reading the textbook "Core Java, Volumne I - Fundamentals, 11th Edition" by Cay S. Horstmann to teach it to myself. The example presented here is actually derived from an example in the aforementioned textbook, however I know the best way to learn is to implement a project, even a small one, using what I've learned. 

I'll continue to learn about concurrency concepts using this textbook. This being said, there'll probably be more example projects to come.
